Personal Statement
------------------

The proposed PhD aims to provide evidence which commercial decision makers around the world can use to craft innovative product launch strategies, engaging large audiences with low investment capital. This is a natural progression of the Enigmaker project which I completed during my recent sabbatical year.

The Highwire programme will provide academic rigour and entrepreneurial insights to complement my interests and expertise in conceiving, prototyping and deploying freely-licensed digital products and experiences over ten years of work in industrial R&D. The colleagues I have so far met on the programme represent a dream team of collaborators for the challenges on offer as part of the structured MRes. 

I also anticipate opportunities to engage partners in more playful and expressive projects alongside the main programme of work, building on the portfolio of interactive artworks I have developed as founder member of the Curiosity Collective in Ipswich. 

I acknowledge that the scope of work is likely to change radically following the first year, but Dr Mike Chiasson would be a natural supervisor for the scope of the thesis as proposed, having already expressed an interest in work which instruments and analyses real-world-instances of the new digital economy.
