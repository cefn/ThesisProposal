Abstract
--------

This document outlines the rationale and begins to explore methods for a novel form of experiment, an experiment which should help us better understand the flow of value in the new digital economy. 

It is proposed to launch a new startup, conceived and instrumented as a vehicle to collect experimental evidence under controlled conditions to compare two alternative business strategies, liberal licensing versus license enforcement.

The data gathered should help strategists map out a key aspect of the emerging digital economy, and shed light on a fundamental question for their business; When should creatives or their employers allow others the freedom to exploit creative output, and when should they register and impose intellectual property rights to limit that freedom, in order to achieve the greatest commercial gain?


Background
----------

Society profits hugely from the free flow of insight and information. Its beneficiaries can build upon shared work enabling them to achieve things which would otherwise be out of their reach. However, creative professionals are invited to employ the legal measures of patent and copyright to achieve the opposite. Where a creator can create obstacles for others to benefit from their work it is frequently assumed that they should attempt to do so.

Many business strategies, when taken at face value, are concerned with prevention; limiting the flow of information, and limiting the scope for others to act. The limitations imposed by creators clearly come at a cost to society, but in extreme cases can also disadvantage customers and choke the intended commercial dividend. The naive application of the preventive principle can not only restrict our liberties, but actually disadvantage the business itself, leaving no winners at all. Business losses can take place directly through loss of market share or revenue because of the restricted freedoms around a product. The opportunity cost of missing out on a potential strategic position, customer relationship or other profitable mechanism lubricated by openness and sharing can also be significant. These are easily overlooked until a competitor demonstrates their value.

In common with many industry commentators, I consider it a matter of historical fact that the limitations on consumer freedoms imposed by industry-approved digital music initiatives disadvantaged the licensed product against the more accessible and flexible, unlicensed alternative. Where the recording industry has led, a wider group of creatives will no doubt follow.

The commoditisation of both digital hardware and software, and the development of digital fabrication techniques, has led to the emergence of challenging alternative business models, in which Open Source, Creative Commons and similarly liberal licenses act as the architectural foundation of a growing collection of products and services without the encumbrances and transaction friction of rights-controlled resources.

The naive standpoint that the enforcement of all available IP rights will maximise profit has been severely undermined across many industry sectors, but designers, developers and inventors familiar with a licensing model may be ill-equipped to identify alternative value chains available to them, and decide under what circumstances those alternatives will be more profitable. For example, actively facilitating the adoption of your designs by others can create a rich market for consultancy and support which the original creator is uniquely able to anticipate and serve.

Contributors across all industries need an informed standpoint concerning the flow of value in radically liberalised economies of this kind. Strategists need to weigh up which IP rights they should waive, what the form of the expected payback should be, and how they should orient their business in order to best harvest the dividend. However, comparative evidence is hard to come by. 

Despite the scarcity of actionable insight, established companies and seasoned professionals may not be able to simply rest on their laurels and continue with traditional models. As other disruptive innovations have proven, by the time new competitors have emerged and proven the case for liberal licensing it may already be too late to defend existing markets against those playing the game-changing wildcard.

Profile

My experience in industry and the maker community spans the whole spectrum of perspectives on licensing. At one extreme, my work at BT Labs has led to the filing and granting of a number of patents, and the prototyping and deployment of a great deal of trade secret and privately licensed technologies. At the other extreme, I am an author and maintainer of software, workshop facilitator and hacker for open source projects built on Arduino and Processing, creator of the Enigmaker public domain invention project, and the Tacticalendar - a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA-licensed design for a laser-cut consumer product.

As a lead contributor and instigator of emerging technology projects, my role blends naturally into that of the technology strategist, marketeer and entrepreneur, attempting to drive cashflow through the technologies I create. This last perspective is definitive in the scoping of the proposed project. Decisions around the liberal sharing of IPR lack the hard numerical certainties of the profit and loss accounting for conventional markets, and no established heuristics seem to exist which can help structure the decision. 

During the span of the PhD I would like to turn what is today a gut instinct into a more analytically sound picture of the way intangibles can flow through a business, lubricating relationships and facilitating the unlocking of new value. 

During my thesis I intend to establish a quantitative evidence base, which can begin to map a taxonomy of liberty-enhancing business models. 

Building on this model, I would like to identify specific questions for which live market experiments can be created. I would like to work closely with the management school to invent a model for a business to be simultaneously launched through an open brand and a closed brand.

Proponents argue that the liberal licensing of well-known projects such as the linux kernel have been a defining factor in its success, but it's hard to be sure, given we cannot wind back the clock and re-run the experiment.


In recent years, novel commercial approaches have arisen which attempt to find an alternative commercial equilibrium. On this model, creators distribute their works whilst explicitly granting freedoms to others to copy, modify or further innovate. This strategy is not limited to open source software, but has been appropriated and remixed by inventors, craftspeople, writers, musicians to suit their own needs, and formalised through organisations such as the Open Source Initiative and Creative Commons.
